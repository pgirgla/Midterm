                    <p>Hi! I am a Computer Science Engineer, who is now enrolled in Child Development major.</p>
                    <p>This is my first semester and I am enjoying back to school after almost 25 years.</p>
                    <!-- e.g. I love building websites, and learning to code! -->
                    <p>Besides this I love cooking and trying new cusines. My favorite is Italian and Mexican.</p>
                    <p>I am a vegetarian, and love to transform the non-vegeterian recipes into vegetarian dishes 
                       by sustituting with tofu, cottage cheese or mushrooms.</p>
                    <!-- e.g. I spent my weekends in the mountains hiking with my friends. -->
